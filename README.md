Sliding puzzle game.


Just run it with gcc(mingw 64) compiler in vscode or any other.

Some future improvement can be:

- Better graphics (no frequent blinking puzzle).
- Adding a AI puzzle solving capability (eg. A* algorithm, Breadth first search tree algrithm etc.).
- Making code shorter and faster.

Another branch master has 3 by 3 puzzle in it.
