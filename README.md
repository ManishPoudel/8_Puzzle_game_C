Some future improvement can be:

* [ ] Better graphics (no frequent blinking puzzle).
* [ ] Adding a AI puzzle solving capability (eg. A* algorithm, Breadth first search tree algrithm ,Minimax algorithm etc.).
* [ ] Making code shorter and faster.
* [ ] Some sounds while playing would be nice.
* [ ] Adding stop watch and highscore record.
