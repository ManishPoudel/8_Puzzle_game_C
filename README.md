# 8_Puzzle_game_C
# Longer Puzzle with max 25 pieces character.
Sliding puzzle game.


Just run it with gcc(mingw 64) compiler in vscode or any other.

Some future improvement can be:

- Better graphics (no frequent blinking puzzle).
- Adding a AI puzzle solving capability (eg. A* algorithm, Breadth first search tree algrithm etc.).
- Making code shorter and faster.
- Some sounds while playing would be nice.
- Adding stop watch and highscore record.
